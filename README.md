# Data-Visualization-Extraction
Python program to extract data from CSV files, filter them according to user input, and either visualizes the specified data or exports it to a new file.

## Setting Up Environment to Run Program

### Overview
This program is written in Python and uses **Pandas**, a Python library for data analysis and **tkinter** a library for graphical user interfaces. First we will download Python, Pandas and an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment). Instead of downloading everything separately, we will download a everything together in a software package called Anaconda which includes the Python Interpreter (used to run the program), Pandas, tkinter, and many other libraries and accesories.

### Steps:
1) Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/

2) Click the green download button, make sure choose the latest version of Python 3 (3.x)

3) Once download is completed, Open up the IDE, called Spyder, by searching for it and clicking on the icon

4) If you have the Data-Visualization-Extraction program on your computer go to the next step if not, you can download it from GitHub. Google it.

5) On the Spyder IDE, go to file --> open (top left corner. See below.)

6) Find the GUI.py file wherever it may be on your computer and double click to open

7) right click green arrow button at the top near where it says source (See image above)

8) A graphical user interface should have appeared similar to the one below

9) Enter necessary fields and click whichever action user wants to take (export to excel, plot, etc.)


# Troubleshooting and Requirements
**Important:** 

a) Open the CSV file containing the data

b) Make sure the title of the date column only contains the characters 'Date' (the server used to store data may add other characters like a semicolon)

1) Files where data is stored has to be CSV (not excel)
2) When files are entered, make sure to include extension (.xlsx, .csv, etc.)
3) The files storing the data have to be in the same directory (folder) as all of the files that make up the program
4) **Starting and ending time must be entered in the following format**
    month/day/year hour:minute:second
